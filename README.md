Pitch:
An endless runner where as the user gets more points by jumping over more objects
the game will get faster and the level will change to different obstacles as the game
progresses.

The game starts and the player, which is represented by a bird, must jump over worms that approach from the right side. 
When the player reaches 5, 10, 15, or 20 points the player will advance in level and will have to jump over different obstacles,
as the game progresses the game will get faster. The player is moved up with the click of a spacebar and if the player
hits an obstacle or the top or bottom of the window, the game will end and it will display the players points. 
If the player can make it to the final level, the player will be greeted with balloons that float up
to celebrate the player making it thus far, the balloons dont interact with the environment and 
are just visual.

Instructions:
Move your icon up by clicking the space key, if nothing is pressed the icon will fall.

of the window.
