Pitch:
An endless runner where as the user gets more points by jumping over more objects
the game will get faster and the level will become bigger in scale
the first level will have the user jumping over spikes and the last level will have the user jumping over buildings

Phase 1
- [ ] The character can be seen on screen
- [ ] The character can be moved up with the click of a spacebar
- [ ] We have level designs for all the levels


Phase 2
- [ ] The first level is fully functional
- [ ] The game gets faster as you progress
- [ ] The game can tell when the player collides with obstacles


Phase 3
- [ ] The game displays points
- [ ] The game transitions between levels
- [ ] The game can be started at any level
