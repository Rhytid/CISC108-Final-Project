Pitch:
An endless runner where as the user gets more points by jumping over more objects
the game will get faster and the level will become bigger in scale
the first level will have the user jumping over spikes and the last level will have the user jumping over buildings

Phase 1
- [x] The character can be seen on screen
- [x] The character can be moved up with the click of a spacebar
- [x] We have level plans for all the levels that are an emoji in Designer
      - First Level: Bug Obstacle
      - Second Level: Rock Obstacle
      - Third Level: Baby Obstacle
      - Fourth Level: Dog Obstacle
      - Fifth Level: Cloud Obstacle

Phase 2
- [x] The first level is fully functional
- [x] The game gets faster as you progress
- [x] The game can tell when the player collides with obstacles



Phase 3
- [ ] The game displays points
- [x] The game transitions between levels
- [ ] (Maybe)Have items that float up like balloons in the background for cloud level
